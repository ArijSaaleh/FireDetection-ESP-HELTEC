# FireDetection-ESP-HELTEC
solution is to develop a device that can measure temperature
and detect wind direction to create a weather map of the forest
that can be visualized and manipulated on a platform. 
This map allows the evaluation of the fire risk 
and the prediction of the danger's direction of propagation.
